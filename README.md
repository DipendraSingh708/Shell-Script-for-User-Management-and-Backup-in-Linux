# Shell-Script-for-User-Management-and-Backup-in-Linux

## Tools Required:
- Linux Operating System (any popular distribution like Ubuntu, Fedora,
etc.)
- Bash Shell
- Git and GitHub (for version control and code repository)
- Text Editor (like Vim, Nano, or Visual Studio Code)
  
# Overview/Description:

This project involves creating a shell script that automates user
management tasks and backup processes in a Linux environment. The primary goal is to enable efficient
management of user
accounts and secure backup of specified directories. Learners will apply
their knowledge of Linux
commands, shell scripting, and GitHub to develop, version control, and
share their script.

# Code Repository:

- Repository Platform: GitHub
- Repository Link: https://github.com/DipendraSingh708/Shell-Script-for-User-Management-and-Backup-in-Linux
- Access Instructions: Clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Instructions on cloning a repository can be found on GitHub's help pages.

# Requirements:

## 1. Functional Requirements:

 - The script should be able to add, delete, and modify user accounts on a Linux system.
 - Include options to create and manage groups for users.
 - Implement a backup feature that compresses and archives a specified directory.
 - The script should provide a user-friendly command-line interface with clear options and usage instructions.
## 2. Non-Functional Requirements:
- Performance: The script should execute tasks swiftly and efficiently.
- Security: Ensure that the script runs with appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
- Portability: The script should be executable on different Linux distributions without needing significant modifications.
